## Introduction

The job environment in the Philippines changed significantly between 2012 and 2019. In 2012, the annual employment rate was estimated at 93.0 percent, and the total number of employed people reached 37.6 million. It continuously increased over time, reaching a peak of 95.3% in 2016. However, there were minor variations in the following years, and the employment rate eventually settled at 94.8% in 2019. Contrary to this, the unemployment rate, which measures the proportion of the labor force that is actively looking for work but is unable to find it, was 7.0% in 2012. This rate subsequently fell, reaching a low of 4.7% in 2016. It did, however, stabilize at 5.3% in both 2018 and 2019, showing a rather steady but nevertheless tough unemployed condition. Despite gains in employment rates, the job environment remained challenging. Informal and underemployment remained common, particularly in rural regions, making it difficult for people to find steady and respectable jobs. Youth unemployment has arisen as a major issue, with many young Filipinos finding it difficult to find acceptable career opportunities that fit their abilities and goals.

The Philippine government adopted a number of efforts and programs to address these issues, including those that promoted job creation, improved skill development, and closed the gap between employment supply and demand. With these initiatives, it was hoped to promote equitable growth, enhance labor market results, and provide the workforce—especially young people—better possibilities.The Philippines had issues including underemployment and young unemployment from 2012 to 2019, despite gains in employment rates. The government's measures showed a dedication to tackling these problems and fostering inclusive labor market growth. The country's employment prospects will need to continue to improve as more opportunities are created, gaps are closed, and workers are given the training they need.

The project provides an evident connection to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, which aims to promote equitable and sustainable economic growth, high-quality employment, and opportunities for all people to engage in valuable jobs. This project aims to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities involved in promoting sustainable and productive work for everyone. Our study offers policymakers and stakeholders essential insights that help in the creation of successful economic recovery plans through an assessment of changes in employment rates, job losses, and industry shifts. The objective we have is to increase awareness of the difficulties and opportunities associated with offering chances for sustainable and productive work to all Filipinos by coordinating our efforts with the values included in SDG 8.

## Statement of the Problem
The biggest issues facing the Philippines are underemployment and unemployment, which are also major measures of the health of the economy. The societal implications of this widespread unemployment range from lost income to serious social and psychological issues brought on by feeling unemployed and uncertain about the future. It results in significant societal inefficiencies overall. This chapter provides a thorough inventory of the information and literature on the labor markets in the Philippines. The activity encompasses labor market outcomes and trends, as well as labor market regulations and significant problems that have an impact on the labor market. The exercise's main concern is whether the labor market's alleged rigidity in the Philippines is to blame for unemployment and whether it prevents jobs from being created. Therefore, various sectors have raised the possibility of labor market reforms as a way to promote economic growth. Except in a few instances, governments actually do interfere in the labor market to strike a balance between the goals of fairness, efficiency, and risk distribution. However, in reality, labor market changes usually aim to lessen government involvement. Because employees and employers have unequal market power due to inadequate worker mobility, a lack of adequate information, or discrimination, labor markets are frequently not competitive. These flaws result in unjust and ineffective outcomes, such as immobile, underpaid workers, risky working conditions, or discrimination against specific worker groups (such as women) who have poor bargaining power. Similarly, unregulated private markets do a terrible job of protecting unemployed people. Governments generally step in to address these shortcomings. But there might be an issue. For instance, a poorly planned government action that ends up providing undue protection to a small number of insiders in the formal sector could make matters worse. In fact, excessive worker protection (such as through prohibitively expensive and onerous dismissal clauses) may discourage firms from taking on new hires, thus driving those individuals into the unofficial sector or open unemployment.

## Significance of the Study
Unemployment rate has had several noticeable effects on the Philippines over the years. Since 2014, the unemployment rate has been declining until 2019. In 2019, the unemployment rate in the Philippines was at approximately 2.24 percent and on a steady downward trend from 3.6 percent in 2014. To solve this issue, the proponents proposed a title that aims to develop an employment status of the citizens of the Philippines that will give information on how affected our Filipino workers are. The submitted data, which is presented in this proposed study, will be used as the foundation for applying potential fixes to the stated issue. This project will provide a variety of data sets exemplifying the unemployment rate in the Philippines. This research will be useful for the following purposes:

The Students. For those students who will be needing data that may be found from the project. This will allow them to have a thorough understanding of the Philippines unemployment rate between 2012-2019.

The Professors. For professors who will be teaching about the unemployment rate in the Philippines through the years. The information collected in the project can  be utilized in their courses.

The Government. For selected government officials who will be needing data that they may use to projects related to unemployment rate.

The Private and public sectors. For selected private and public sectors who will be needing data that may be used for their future projects. It can act as a general framework and foundation for figuring out which solutions should probably be given priority. 

The Future Researchers. For the researchers to provide background information concerning unemployment rate in the Philippines. This project’s analytics can provide them with new insights, suggestions, and conclusions. 


## Method
In accordance with our methodology, we have gathered data from a variety of trustworthy sources, including official statistics, polls, and government publications, to investigate the employment status in the Philippines from 2012 to 2019. Our analysis primarily centers on understanding the impact of various factors on the nation's labor market during this period, with a specific emphasis on the employment landscape. We will examine adjustments in employment rates, job losses, and changes to the industries affected by these shifts. Furthermore, our research will delve into the efficacy of governmental initiatives and regulations implemented to address the economic effects on employment. By conducting a thorough analysis of the collected data, we aim to provide insightful information about the employment situation in the Philippines during this seven-year timeframe. The findings of this study will contribute to a better understanding of employment dynamics and inform future strategies for economic development and recovery.


## Expected Output
In order to identify significant trends and patterns in the data, the project aims to examine the employment status in the Philippines from 2012 to 2019. Through a comprehensive investigation, the researcher will gain insights and develop accurate observations without making assumptions. If the study reveals deteriorating employment conditions and establishes a clear correlation between variables, it can serve as a foundation for raising awareness and addressing the underlying causes of employment issues during this period. The findings will provide valuable insights for further research and the development of effective strategic strategies. The government can draw inspiration from successful strategies implemented by other countries and adapt them to address the job crisis during this time frame. Moreover, it is crucial to proactively raise awareness, especially among the younger generation, through advocacy campaigns and initiatives that address the adverse consequences of the employment situation in the Philippines from 2012 to 2019.


### Conclusion and Analysis
* In year 2019 NCR and Region IV-A has the same amount of employees that was employed.
* CAR or Cordillera Administrative Region has the least employee status on Philippines
* NCR have the highest employee in all of the regions
