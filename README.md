## Introduction

The job environment in the Philippines changed significantly between 2012 and 2019. In 2012, the annual employment rate was estimated at 93.0 percent, and the total number of employed people reached 37.6 million. It continuously increased over time, reaching a peak of 95.3% in 2016. However, there were minor variations in the following years, and the employment rate eventually settled at 94.8% in 2019. Contrary to this, the unemployment rate, which measures the proportion of the labor force that is actively looking for work but is unable to find it, was 7.0% in 2012. This rate subsequently fell, reaching a low of 4.7% in 2016. It did, however, stabilize at 5.3% in both 2018 and 2019, showing a rather steady but nevertheless tough unemployed condition. Despite gains in employment rates, the job environment remained challenging. Informal and underemployment remained common, particularly in rural regions, making it difficult for people to find steady and respectable jobs. Youth unemployment has arisen as a major issue, with many young Filipinos finding it difficult to find acceptable career opportunities that fit their abilities and goals.

The Philippine government adopted a number of efforts and programs to address these issues, including those that promoted job creation, improved skill development, and closed the gap between employment supply and demand. With these initiatives, it was hoped to promote equitable growth, enhance labor market results, and provide the workforce—especially young people—better possibilities.The Philippines had issues including underemployment and young unemployment from 2012 to 2019, despite gains in employment rates. The government's measures showed a dedication to tackling these problems and fostering inclusive labor market growth. The country's employment prospects will need to continue to improve as more opportunities are created, gaps are closed, and workers are given the training they need.

The project provides an evident connection to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, which aims to promote equitable and sustainable economic growth, high-quality employment, and opportunities for all people to engage in valuable jobs. This project aims to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities involved in promoting sustainable and productive work for everyone. Our study offers policymakers and stakeholders essential insights that help in the creation of successful economic recovery plans through an assessment of changes in employment rates, job losses, and industry shifts. The objective we have is to increase awareness of the difficulties and opportunities associated with offering chances for sustainable and productive work to all Filipinos by coordinating our efforts with the values included in SDG 8.

## Statement of the Problem
One of the most serious work problems since the Great Depression has been brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a genuine risk that the crisis will worsen inequality and poverty, with the effects lasting for years. Currently, nations must make every effort to prevent this job crisis from developing into a social disaster. It is crucial to make an investment in the future and in future generations by rebuilding a better and more resilient labor market.

In the Philippines, COVID-19 instances initially emerged gradually. On January 30, 2020, the first verified case was recorded, and on February 2, the first fatality. On March 7, local broadcasting was declared. 217,396 confirmed cases, 157,403 recoveries, and 3,520 fatalities were recorded by August 30. The capital's metropolis of Manila had the most cases.

Lockdown measures were put in place as the pandemic spread faster. The World Health Organization classified COVID-19 as a global epidemic on March 11. Beginning on March 15, Metro Manila was placed under a stringent community quarantine that forbade mass meetings, travel, and the opening of schools. The largest island region, Luzon, was placed under Enhanced Community Quarantine for a period of six months.

Only one individual per family was permitted to leave the house for necessities during the Enhanced Community Quarantine. Only enterprises in vital industries were permitted to continue, while all others were required to implement work-from-home policies. Many workers' lives were disturbed by strict lockdown procedures. Various government agencies undertook financial aid programs, supported vital industries, and hoarding prevention measures between March 12 and April 15.

The "Bayanihan to Heal as One Act," which gave the president emergency powers to deal with the COVID-19 situation, was signed by the president on March 24. The Enhanced Community Quarantine was extended to include all of Luzon through April 30. Additional actions were taken to assist the impacted enterprises, to put out aid proposals, and to create strategies for academic and vocational training.

In April, it was announced that both the General Community Quarantine and the Enhanced Community Quarantine will be extended. Under the General Community Quarantine, a few places of business, like gyms and places of amusement, remained shut. From May 16 to May 31, Metro Manila, Laguna, and Cebu City were subject to a modified enhanced community quarantine, allowing for some movement and a gradual reopening of the economy.

In Metro Manila and several provinces, the country underwent a change from Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine to General Community Quarantine, while the remainder of the nation was placed under Modified General Community Quarantine. Depending on the severity of the COVID-19 infection in each place, the length and strictness of the community quarantine varied.

## Significance of the Study
Unemployment rate has had several noticeable effects on the Philippines over the years. Since 2014, the unemployment rate has been declining until 2019. In 2019, the unemployment rate in the Philippines was at approximately 2.24 percent and on a steady downward trend from 3.6 percent in 2014. To solve this issue, the proponents proposed a title that aims to develop an employment status of the citizens of the Philippines that will give information on how affected our Filipino workers are. The submitted data, which is presented in this proposed study, will be used as the foundation for applying potential fixes to the stated issue. This project will provide a variety of data sets exemplifying the unemployment rate in the Philippines. This research will be useful for the following purposes:

The Students. For those students who will be needing data that may be found from the project. This will allow them to have a thorough understanding of the Philippines unemployment rate between 2012-2019.

The Professors. For professors who will be teaching about the unemployment rate in the Philippines through the years. The information collected in the project can  be utilized in their courses.

The Government. For selected government officials who will be needing data that they may use to projects related to unemployment rate.

The Private and public sectors. For selected private and public sectors who will be needing data that may be used for their future projects. It can act as a general framework and foundation for figuring out which solutions should probably be given priority. 

The Future Researchers. For the researchers to provide background information concerning unemployment rate in the Philippines. This project’s analytics can provide them with new insights, suggestions, and conclusions. 


## Method
In accordance with our methodology, we have gathered data from a variety of trustworthy sources, including official statistics, polls, and government publications, to investigate the employment status in the Philippines from 2012 to 2019. Our analysis primarily centers on understanding the impact of various factors on the nation's labor market during this period, with a specific emphasis on the employment landscape. We will examine adjustments in employment rates, job losses, and changes to the industries affected by these shifts. Furthermore, our research will delve into the efficacy of governmental initiatives and regulations implemented to address the economic effects on employment. By conducting a thorough analysis of the collected data, we aim to provide insightful information about the employment situation in the Philippines during this seven-year timeframe. The findings of this study will contribute to a better understanding of employment dynamics and inform future strategies for economic development and recovery.


## Expected Output
In order to identify significant trends and patterns in the data, the project aims to examine the employment status in the Philippines from 2012 to 2019. Through a comprehensive investigation, the researcher will gain insights and develop accurate observations without making assumptions. If the study reveals deteriorating employment conditions and establishes a clear correlation between variables, it can serve as a foundation for raising awareness and addressing the underlying causes of employment issues during this period. The findings will provide valuable insights for further research and the development of effective strategic strategies. The government can draw inspiration from successful strategies implemented by other countries and adapt them to address the job crisis during this time frame. Moreover, it is crucial to proactively raise awareness, especially among the younger generation, through advocacy campaigns and initiatives that address the adverse consequences of the employment situation in the Philippines from 2012 to 2019.
